Evolutionary Computing - Task 1: Specialist Agent

This code contains different functions for training two instances of GA10 (one with 1-step mutation and another one with n-step mutation) on 8 possible different enemies. The base controllers and functions, together with some parts of the code, are based on/inspired by the work of Karine Miras et al. (2016).

- final_EA1.py, function that runs EA1 for a specified enemy and saves results of the runs and best individuals based on individual gain
- final_EA2.py, function that runs EA2 for a specified enemy and saves results of the runs and best individuals based on individual gain
- best_individual.py, function that runs the best individual of each run for a specific enemy, given enemy number and EA number
- plotting_final.py, function that plots line and boxplots to compare the 2 EAs when passed an enemy as a parameter, also calculates T-Tests or Kolmogorov-Smirnov Tests after checking for normality
